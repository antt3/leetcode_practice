# leetcode_practice
<br>My Leetcode repo to keep track of my progress.
<br>Each folder is named with the language I use to solve the problem in each file.
<br>I list my solutions in the files, as well as any ideal solution I find to reference later.
<br>Readme is looking kinda bare, added a couple memes to fill up the space.
